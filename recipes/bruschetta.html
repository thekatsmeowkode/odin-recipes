    <h2>A delicious serving of bruschetta on toast</h2>
    <p>This is quite easily one of the most easy and satisfying foods that is quick to assemble and tastes better each time
        you eat as leftovers, as the tomatoes soak in brine and develop flavor and soft texture. I think of it as the worlds
        fastest pizza if served on toasted bread with cheese. </p>
    <ul>Ingredients
        <li>1 pint any variety of tomatoes, although best results with cherry, grape or plum tomatoes. Please shop local and
            support farmers</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Balsamic vinegar (red or white)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>

        <li>10-15 leaves of fresh basil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Bread, as many slices as you like. Rustic or fresh bread is preferable to make crunch</li>
        <li>Cheese of choice, melting varieties such as jack or mozzarella preferred</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>Instructions
        <li>Chop tomatoes into halves or quarters</li>
        <li>Combine all ingredients in bowl and mix(except for bread and cheese)</li>
        <li>Toast bread with cheese on top in toaster oven for about 10 minutes at 375 degrees</li>
        <li>Serve bruschetta on top of bread</li>
    </ol>
